    <h1>Personal Reflection – To-Do Task Manager</h1>
    <p>
      Working on this to-do task manager project was both rewarding and educational. At first, I expected it to be simple — just a few forms and a task list — but I quickly realized how many small technical decisions and challenges come with even basic web apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the biggest things I learned was how Google Apps Script can act as a full backend system when combined with Google Sheets. Before this, I didn't know it was possible to create login systems, session handling, and real-time data updates all within Apps Script. It opened my eyes to how powerful free tools can be when used creatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I faced a number of unexpected issues, especially with UI bugs, like sections overlapping, password fields misaligning, or sessions not clearing properly. At times it was frustrating, especially when something small like a missing CSS class made the entire layout break. But fixing those problems helped me understand debugging better, and I now feel more confident when reading error messages and thinking through what might be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most satisfying moment was seeing the tasks actually update in Google Sheets, tied to each specific user. It felt like building something real — not just a school project. Styling the interface and replacing the delete button with a checkmark for task completion was a small detail, but I really liked how it improved the user experience. It made me think more like a designer, not just a coder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I’d like to try making the app run completely outside Apps Script using fetch() and maybe add encryption for the passwords to make it more secure. Overall, I’m proud of how it turned out and I definitely learned a lot more than I expected when I started.
