<h2>üìå 4. Testing &amp; Iteration (First Round) (Required) Documented Red-Teaming (First Round)</h2>
<p>Teams Who Red-Teamed Your Site:</p>
<p>Team 1 - Ladies&amp;Gentlemen:</p>
<p>We saw your team project with my team members and it is quite good, and our conclusion is the Encryption Playground works well and shows strong technical skills. The interface is simple and the encryption runs smoothly using CryptoJS. I liked how quickly it processes input with modern algorithms. However, adding some short instructions would help beginners understand each function better. A small log or side-by-side result view could also improve visibility. Overall, great job, clean, functional, and just needs a few user-friendly touches to be perfect)</p>
<p>Team 2 - GG:</p>
<p>Encryption Playground ‚Äì Review What‚Äôs Good: Clean, user-friendly design. Real-time encryption and decryption Supports multiple algorithms like Caesar and Vigen√®re Ciphers. Easy to understand (the explanations are helpful) and great for beginners. Engaging, hands-on learning experience. What Could Be Improved: Include user accounts to track progress and save past sessions. Completely depends on person but maybe adding some color would make the site look more fun and make the user eager to try it( it would work on me for sure lol) Overall, the Encryption Playground is helpful and educational tool for those who are interested in the cryptography. It‚Äôs looks good.</p>
<p>Feedback Received:</p>
<p>The Encryption Playground is a clean, user-friendly, and educational tool that effectively demonstrates various encryption algorithms like Caesar and Vigen√®re using CryptoJS. Users appreciated the smooth functionality, real-time processing, and helpful explanations that make it beginner-friendly and engaging. Suggestions for improvement include adding brief instructions, a result log or side-by-side output view, user accounts to track progress, and a more colorful interface to enhance visual appeal and user engagement. Overall, it‚Äôs a well-made project with strong technical execution and minor areas for UI/UX enhancements.</p>
<p>Changes/Improvements Made: Based on the feedback received, we added an Instructions section with clear explanations to help users understand how to use the program more easily. We also improved the button labels and overall UI to make the interface more intuitive and beginner-friendly. While the idea of adding user accounts was considered, we decided not to implement it at this stage, as it would require significant backend development and a secure database to store user information.</p>
<h2>üìå 5. Creative Enhancements (Required) Documented Creative Enhancements</h2>
<p>Selected Enhancements:</p>
<p>We added educational explanations to help users understand how each encryption algorithm works. The UI was improved to make interaction more intuitive, and we made sure all features were accessible from a single HTML file without external libraries.</p>
<p>Issues Encountered:</p>
<p>ChatGPT initially provided incomplete code and required external libraries from GitHub, which we didn‚Äôt want. AppScript errors occurred frequently, and AI tools like Claude.ai had input limits that slowed us down.</p>
<p>Final Decisions/Solutions:</p>
<p>We asked ChatGPT to combine all necessary code into a single HTML file to avoid external dependencies. We worked together to troubleshoot errors step-by-step and used multiple AI accounts when needed to overcome code length and input limitations.</p>
<h2>üìå 6. Testing &amp; Iteration (After Enhancements) (Required) Documented Red-Teaming (Second Round)</h2>
<p>Teams Who Red-Teamed Your Enhanced Site:</p>
<p>Team 1: Ladies &amp; Gentlemen</p>
<p>Team 2: team GG</p>
<p>Feedback Received:</p>
<p>Team 1 appreciated the cleaner UI and the addition of the instructions section, which made the tool easier to understand.</p>
<p>Team 2 highlighted the strong technical execution, smooth functionality, and usefulness for beginners.</p>
<p>Further Refinements Made:</p>
<p>We added clear instructions and improved the labeling and layout of the UI to make interactions easier. User accounts were not added due to complexity, but visual clarity and usability were prioritized.</p>

<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Summary of What Was Done</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Team Formation</td>
<td>We formed our team with our friends so that we can understand each other better and work on the project together in real time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm Research</td>
<td>We explored a variety of encryption algorithms. Each was researched for its historical background, type (simple, intermediate, advanced), and internet application. This helped us understand both the technical depth and real-world use cases. ChatGPT helped us choose algorithms</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Algorithm Selection</td>
<td>We selected algorithms that offered a balance between simplicity for beginners and real-world relevance. These included Caesar, Atbash, and Vigen√®re for classical ciphers, and AES, RSA, and XOR for modern encryption. The choice ensured educational value and interactive experimentation for users.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Implementation</td>
<td>One member (Abu) acted as the main developer, working closely with ChatGPT to build the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with CryptoJS. Several technical issues occurred, including incomplete file generation and reliance on external libraries. Eventually, all required code and libraries were merged into a single HTML file for smoother performance.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Testing &amp; Iteration (First Round)</td>
<td>The team tested the initial version together, noting that while encryption worked well, the interface needed clearer buttons and basic instructions. AppScript integration caused recurring errors. As testers, we worked collaboratively to identify problems and gradually fixed them through multiple trials with ChatGPT.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Creative Enhancements</td>
<td>We added an Instructions section to explain each function and help beginners understand the encryption process. The UI was updated for better clarity, and all dependencies were moved into one HTML file. Although user accounts were suggested, we chose not to implement them due to time and database limitations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Testing &amp; Iteration (Second Round)</td>
<td>Red-teaming was done by team members and ChatGPT as an external reviewer. Feedback praised the smooth functionality and beginner-friendly features, and suggested improvements like a result log, user accounts, and visual enhancements. Based on this, we improved UI clarity and layout, though user accounts were postponed due to technical constraints.</td>

<td>Abu</td>
<td>I did the role of the developer of the website. I mostly worked with AI and chose algorithms. I had quite a difficult time talking with ChatGPT because it made some errors and I had to talk more to fix it. It even couldn&#x27;t provide the .html file sometimes as you can see in the chat. When chatGPT made the first website for me I needed to install some external libraries through github(which I didn&#x27;t wanna do) so I just asked CHatGPT to include all of them in a single .html file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Khan</td>
<td>I performed as a tester for the project. I sat together with Abu(developer) and discussed the potential or visible problems. One of the problems we encountered was External libraries(mentioned by Abu) in that moment, ChatGPT also gave us a hard time understanding the task. When asked to merge all the files together it couldn&#x27;t fully merge them together(shown in the task) we also had a hard time working with AppScript because the error popped up again and again but we eventually fixed it(available in the chat).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Samandar</td>
<td>I did the role of the documentation of the website. First of all i discussed with boys every problem and what we have to do. The main problem is like a limit of the claude.ai and also it has got a limit on putting words as well as codes for the website. However we had a Chatchpt with subscription but Chatchpt can not work like how claude ai worked without subscription. Even if we had subscription we asked lots of times to Chpt to make us code which works but the Chpt can not make which works for us and after trying for more than seven times we got the code which works but before that we used two accounts to make one website code because of the limitation of the claude.ai we couldn&#x27;t make code for the website but we got a idea because of limit we put on claude.ai half of the code so it can continue working and making website code which was ready to show our teacher but we mistaken it is not that easy to make a website code which really works so we continue working with Chatchpt and we finally got the code which we asked from it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Norman</td>
<td>I mostly worked with the Design of the project and provided some concepts that looked very much like professional websites. However, due to some difficulties the project we worked on had changed over time. We carefully selected our color palette to create a professional and modern cryptography website. We also wanted to give some understanding by providing directions throughout the website interface.</td>
